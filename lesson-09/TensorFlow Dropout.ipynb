    "\n",
    "**keep_prob** allows you to adjust the number of units to drop. In order to compensate for dropped units, **tf.nn.dropout()** multiplies all units that are kept (i.e. not dropped) by **1/keep_prob**.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, a good starting value for **keep_prob** is **0.5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "During testing, use a **keep_prob** value of **1.0** to keep all units and maximize the power of the model."
