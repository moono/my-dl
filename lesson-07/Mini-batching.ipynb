    "## Mini-batching\n",
    "* In this section, you'll go over what mini-batching is and how to apply it in TensorFlow.\n",
    "* Mini-batching is a technique for training on subsets of the dataset instead of all the data at one time. This provides the ability to train a model, even if a computer lacks the memory to store the entire dataset.\n",
    "* Mini-batching is computationally inefficient, since you can't calculate the loss simultaneously across all samples. However, this is a small price to pay in order to be able to run the model at all.\n",
    "* It's also quite useful combined with SGD. The idea is to randomly shuffle the data at the start of each epoch, then create the mini-batches. For each mini-batch, you train the network weights with gradient descent. Since these batches are random, you're performing SGD with each batch.\n",
    "* Let's look at the MNIST dataset with weights and a bias to see if your machine can handle it."

    "* In order to use mini-batching, you must first divide your data into batches.\n",
    "* Unfortunately, it's sometimes impossible to divide the data into batches of exactly equal size. For example, imagine you'd like to create batches of 128 samples each from a dataset of 1000 samples. Since 128 does not evenly divide into 1000, you'd wind up with 7 batches of 128 samples, and 1 batch of 104 samples. (7*128 + 1*104 = 1000)\n",
    "* In that case, the size of the batches would vary, so you need to take advantage of TensorFlow's tf.placeholder() function to receive the varying batch sizes.\n",
    "* Continuing the example, if each sample had n_input = 784 features and n_classes = 10 possible labels, the dimensions for features would be [None, n_input] and labels would be [None, n_classes].\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* What does _**None**_ do here?\n",
    "* The _**None**_ dimension is a placeholder for the batch size. At runtime, TensorFlow will accept any batch size greater than 0.\n",
